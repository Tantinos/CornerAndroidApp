# CornerAndroidApp

This is the solution for Corner android exercise. 

How the app works?

The app is reading a csv file and display the information to the user.
The top graph is about the frequency of the punches divided every 15 seconds.
Below there are 3 layouts about the total number punches, average punches speed and average punches power of the round. The icons are
generated random(because i dont have statists of previous round)
Below there are 6 bar graphs about the types of the punches.
After that there is countdown bar to let the user knows when the next round is going to start.
On the bottom you can found the rest seconds, reset text that restart the countdown timer and a button to start the next round.
